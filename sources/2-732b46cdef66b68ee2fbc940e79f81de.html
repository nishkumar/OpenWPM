Facebook has failed to stop the fake ads despite repeat complaints and action on his part, thereby &#8212; he contends &#8212; tarnishing his reputation and causing victims to be lured into costly scams.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt is consistent, it is repeated. Other companies such as Outbrain who have run these adverts have taken them down. What is particularly pernicious about Facebook is that it says the onus is on me, so I have spent time and effort and stress repeatedly to have them taken down,&#8221; Lewis told\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2018\/apr\/22\/martin-lewis-sues-facebook-over-fake-ads-with-his-name\">The Guardian<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt is facilitating scams on a constant basis in a morally repugnant way. If\u00a0Mark Zuckerburg\u00a0wants to be the champion of moral causes, then he needs to stop its company doing this.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.moneysavingexpert.com\/2018\/04\/20\/martin-lewis-to-sue-facebook\/?_ga=2.208275221.664700487.1524473826-977416281.1524473826\">blog post<\/a>\u00a0Lewis also argues it should not be difficult for Facebook &#8212; &#8220;a leader in face and text recognition&#8221; &#8212; to prevent scammers from misappropriating his image.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I don\u2019t do adverts. I\u2019ve told Facebook that. Any ad with my picture or name in is without my permission. I\u2019ve asked it not to publish them, or at least to check their legitimacy with me before publishing. This shouldn\u2019t be difficult,&#8221; he writes. &#8220;Yet it simply continues to repeatedly publish these adverts and then relies on me to report them, once the damage has been done.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Enough is enough. I\u2019ve been fighting for over a year to stop Facebook letting scammers use my name and face to rip off vulnerable people \u2013 yet it continues. I feel sick each time I hear of another victim being conned because of trust they wrongly thought they were placing in me. One lady had over \u00a3100,000 taken from her,&#8221; he adds.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the fake ads appear to be related to cryptocurrency scams &#8212; linking through to fake news articles promising &#8220;revolutionary Bitcoin home-based opportunity&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>So the scammers look to be using the same playbook as the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/2017\/02\/veles-macedonia-fake-news\/\">Macedonian teens<\/a> who, in 2016, concocted fake news stories about US politics to generate a mint in ad clicks &#8212; also relying on Facebook&#8217;s platform to distribute their fakes and scale the scam.<\/p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/01\/30\/facebook-is-banning-cryptocurrency-and-ico-ads\/\">January<\/a> Facebook revised its ads policy to specifically ban\u00a0cryptocurrency, binary options and initial coin offerings. But as Lewis&#8217; samples show, the scammers are circumventing this prohibition with ease &#8212; using Lewis&#8217; image to drive unwitting clicks to a secondary offsite layer of fake news articles that directly push people towards crypto scams.<\/p>\n<p>It would appear that Facebook does nothing to verify the sites to which ads on its platform are directing its users, just as it does not appear to proactive police whether ad creative is legal &#8212; at least unless nudity is involved.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s one sample fake ad that Lewis highlights:<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1626497\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/screen-shot-2018-04-23-at-11-08-23-am.png?w=518\" alt=\"\" width=\"518\" height=\"498\" \/><\/p>\n<p>And here&#8217;s the fake news article it links to &#8212; touting a &#8220;revolutionary&#8221; Bitcoin opportunity, in a news article style mocked up to look like the Daily Mirror newspaper&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1626498\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/screen-shot-2018-04-23-at-11-10-08-am.png?w=578\" alt=\"\" width=\"578\" height=\"337\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The lawsuit is a personal action by Lewis who is seeking exemplary damages in the high court. He says he&#8217;s not looking to profit himself &#8212; saying he would donate any winnings to charities that aim to combat fraud. Rather he says he&#8217;s taking the action in the hopes the publicity will spotlight the problem and force Facebook to stamp out fake ads.<\/p>\n<p>In a statement, Mark Lewis of the law firm Seddons, which Lewis has engaged for the action, said:\u00a0\u201cFacebook is not above the law \u2013 it cannot hide outside the UK and think that it is untouchable.\u00a0 Exemplary damages are being sought. This means we will ask the court to ensure they are substantial enough that Facebook can\u2019t simply see paying out damages as just the \u2018cost of business\u2019 and carry on regardless. It needs to be shown that the price of causing misery is very high.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In a response statement to the suit, a Facebook spokesperson told us:\u00a0\u201cWe do not allow adverts which are\u00a0misleading or false on Facebook and have explained to Martin Lewis that he should report any adverts that infringe his rights and they will be removed. We are in direct contact with his team, offering to help and promptly investigating their requests, and only last week confirmed that several adverts and accounts that violated our Advertising Policies had been taken down.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Facebook&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/policies\/ads\/\">ad guidelines<\/a>\u00a0do indeed prohibit\u00a0ads that contain &#8220;deceptive, false, or misleading content, including deceptive claims, offers, or business practices&#8221; &#8212; and, as noted above, they also specifically prohibit cryptocurrency-related ads.<\/p>\n<p>But, as is increasingly evident where big tech platforms are concerned, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/03\/03\/no-one-wants-to-build-a-feel-good-internet\/\">meaningful enforcement<\/a> of existing policies is what&#8217;s sorely lacking.<\/p>\n<p>The social behemoth claims to have invested significant resources in its ad review program &#8212; which includes both automated and manual review of ads.\u00a0Though it also relies on users reporting problem content,\u00a0thereby shifting the burden of actively policing content its systems are algorithmically distributing and monetizing (at massive scale) onto individual users (who are, by the by, not being paid for all this content review labor&#8230; hmmm&#8230; ).<\/p>\n<p>In Lewis&#8217; case the burden is clearly also highly personal, given the fake ads are not just dodgy content but are directly misappropriating his image and name in an attempt to sell a scam.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;On a personal note, as well as the huge amount of time, stress and effort it takes to continually combat these scams, this whole episode has been extremely depressing \u2013 to see my reputation besmirched by such a big company, out of an unending greed to keep raking in its ad cash,\u201d he also writes.<\/p>\n<p>The sheer scale of Facebook&#8217;s platform &#8212; which now has more than 2BN active users globally &#8212; contrasts awkwardly with the far smaller number of people the company employs for content moderation tasks.<\/p>\n<p>And unsurprisingly, given that huge discrepancy, Facebook has been facing increasing pressure over various types of problem content in recent years &#8212; from <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/10\/30\/russian-backed-content-may-have-reached-126-million-on-facebook\/\">Kremlin propaganda<\/a> to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/03\/13\/un-says-facebook-is-accelerating-ethnic-violence-in-myanmar\/\">hate speech in Myanmar<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2017\/10\/31\/facebook-senate-testimony-doubling-security-group-to-20000-in-2018.html\">Last year<\/a> it told US lawmakers it would be increasing the number of staff working on safety and security issues from 10,000 to 20,000 by the end of this year. Which is still a tiny drop in the ocean of content distributed daily on its platform.

First it sells tons of clothes to learn how clothes are sold. Then it starts selling its own clothes to generate higher gross margin. And now has it has Prime Wardrobe to increase lock-in and reduce points at which customers can choose not to buy Amazon\u2019s own clothing (all while gathering more data about individual preferences); and Echo Look to be its data collection and voice-commerce portal (and as an added bonus, it can route ambiguous purchase requests to its growing inventory of private-label items). If this strategy is successful, it will give Amazon an enormous data moat to drive high-margin sales \u2013 a competitive advantage that will be extremely difficult for fashion retailers and brands to replicate.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1626314\" style=\"width: 627px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-1626314 \" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/tenor-2.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"617\" height=\"416\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bezos doesn&#8217;t need to even ask.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Amazon has become increasingly dominant in several increasingly important arenas: cloud services, voice assistants, self-serving brick-and-mortar stores with Amazon Go, and of course its now-traditional role as the online everything store.

need to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/disrupt-sf-2018\/startup-alley\/\">apply now<\/a>. Our biggest, most ambitious Disrupt ever takes place on Sept. 5-7 at our new venue, Moscone Center West. More than 1,200 exhibitors and sponsors will showcase the very latest technology products, platforms and services in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/disrupt-sf-2018\/startup-alley\/\">Startup Alley<\/a>. Applications are open for a limited time, and we\u2019d hate for you to miss out.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to show your stuff in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/disrupt-sf-2018\/startup-alley\/\">Startup Alley<\/a>, you have two ways to secure a spot \u2014 and <a href=\"http:\/\/apply.techcrunch.com\">both require an application<\/a>. First, early stage startups from any category can purchase a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/disrupt-sf-2018\/startup-alley\/\">Startup Alley Exhibitor Package<\/a>. Pro tip: early applicants will be eligible to score special offers.<\/p>\n<p>The package includes one exhibit day, three Disrupt SF Founder passes (if you apply before July 25), <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/03\/15\/crunchmatch-connects-investors-and-founders-at-disrupt-sf-2018\/\">CrunchMatch<\/a> (our curated investor-to-startup matching platform), use of the Startup Alley exhibitor lounge, access to the Disrupt press list and a chance to be selected as a Wildcard entry to the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/04\/12\/applications-for-startup-battlefield-at-disrupt-sf-are-now-open\/\">Startup Battlefield<\/a> pitch competition (this year\u2019s prize: $100K).<\/p>\n<p>The second way to exhibit \u2014 and score a FREE Startup Alley Exhibitor Package \u2014 is to be selected by the TechCrunch editorial team as a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/pages\/tc-startup-programs\/\">TC Top Pick<\/a>. Our seasoned editorial team will choose 60 companies for this distinction. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/pages\/tc-startup-programs\/\">TC Top Pick<\/a> winners will\u00a0receive one <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/disrupt-sf-2018\/startup-alley\/\">Startup Alley Exhibitor Package<\/a> plus a three-minute Showcase Stage interview.<\/p>\n<p>One caveat: companies vying for a TC Top Pick spot must fit in one of these 12 categories: AI, AR\/VR, Blockchain, BioTech, FinTech, Gaming, HealthTech, Privacy\/Security, Space, Mobility, Retail or Robotics. That&#8217;s five TC Top Pick startups per category.<\/p>\n<p>Why should you exhibit in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/disrupt-sf-2018\/startup-alley\/\">Startup Alley<\/a>? For starters, we\u2019re expecting more than 10,000 attendees and 400 media outlets. Thousands of people pass through <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/disrupt-sf-2018\/startup-alley\/\">Startup Alley<\/a>, and it\u2019s a prime opportunity to find new customers, get media attention, and meet future investors. In fact according to CrunchBase, last year&#8217;s Startup Alley exhibitors raised more than $37M in seed and series-A funding within four months after exhibiting at Disrupt SF. It\u2019s an invigorating atmosphere where you\u2019ll make new connections, exchange ideas and create new opportunities<\/p>\n<p>If you want to be considered for a TC Top Pick, you must apply by June 29. The deadline for Disrupt SF Startup Alley applications is August 8. If that sounds like you have plenty of time, remember: the space will go quickly, and early applicants will receive special offers. Be the early bird. Catch the worm.<\/p>\n<p>You can apply for one or both <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/disrupt-sf-2018\/startup-alley\/\">Startup Alley exhibitor opportunities<\/a> with one application.

Amazon India is among several e-commerce platforms that <a href=\"https:\/\/mybigplunge.com\/news\/news-flash\/capital-float-partnered-with-amazon-india\/\">the company has partnered with to provide loans to sellers<\/a>, including Snapdeal and Shopclues.<\/p>\n<p>Since its inception in 2013 by co-founders Sashank Rishyasringa and Gaurav Hinduja, Capital Float has raised a total of about $110 million in equity funding from investors, including Ribbit Capital, SAIF Partners, Sequoia India, Creation Investments and Aspada, as well as total debt lines of $130 million.<\/p>\n<p>During the last six months, Capital Float added 50,000 new customers, bringing its total customer base to more than 80,000 people in more than 300 cities. The startup says it currently disburses more than 10,000 loans each month and now has an outstanding loan portfolio of more than $170 million, with a default rate of about 2 percent. About 70 percent of its loans are microloans ranging from 25,000 rupees to 500,000 rupees (about $376 to $7,530).<\/p>\n<p>With the investment from <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/amazon\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"amazon\">Amazon, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> the startup has set an ambitious goal of adding 300,000 new customers and originating more than $800 million in loans this year.<\/p>\n<p>In a press statement, Amazon India\u2019s country manager Amit Agarwal said, &#8220;We\u2019re excited to work with Capital Float and invest alongside other investors. We are highly impressed with what Gaurav and Sashank have built and we back missionary entrepreneurs and management teams. Credit in India is highly under-penetrated and Capital Float is bringing the right kind of credit solutions to the underserved and informally served segments of SMEs to help realize their full potential.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Over the last year, Capital Float expanded into more verticals, including products for small- to mid-sized manufacturers, point-of-sale financing for retailers and loans for school construction and self-employed professionals like doctors. It also added new online payment gateways to make it easier for borrowers to repay loans and began piloting deep learning-based underwriting models that use data points like image processing, geotags and new policies such as the Goods and Service Tax (GST), an indirect tax launched last year that is levied at every step of the production chain and the banknote demonetization started by Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government in 2016.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Capital Float, the fintech startup that says it is India\u2019s largest online lender, announced today that it has raised $22 million in new funding from Amazon.

come into effect today. But as before, don&#8217;t expect some big fanfare by broadband providers and a sudden ratcheting up of prices. Things are going to stay quietly tense for a while.<\/p>\n<p>Should you be worried? No. But you should stay <em>angry<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Restoring Internet Freedom&#8221; may have taken effect, but the truth is that the <a href=\"https:\/\/beta.techcrunch.com\/2017\/05\/30\/commission-impossible-how-and-why-the-fcc-created-net-neutrality\/\">2015 net neutrality rules<\/a> have been out of effect since the FCC was shuffled under the new administration. Under Chairman Ajit Pai&#8217;s FCC, those rules were unlikely to be enforced from the day he took over; he was, in fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/08\/15\/fccs-favors-for-sinclair-are-the-natural-byproduct-of-a-pro-industry-agenda\/\">promising industry leaders<\/a> that they&#8217;d be rolled back as soon as possible soon after assuming his new office.<\/p>\n<p>But ISPs, battered but wise from more than a decade of legal battling, knew there was more to it than a friendly face in the FCC. The rules would face serious legal challenges, as the previous ones did for years after <em>their<\/em> adoption. It would be premature to enact policies in the new freedom of the <a href=\"https:\/\/beta.techcrunch.com\/2017\/12\/13\/commission-impossible-part-two-how-enemies-gathered-around-net-neutrality\/\">post-Title-II<\/a> era, though they may allow themselves to hope (and prepare).<\/p>\n<p>As they expected, opposition is organized and actually has a non-trivial chance of success. The popularity, technical accuracy and ironclad legal reputation of the previous rules are nice, but ultimately challenges must be based on shortcomings in the new rules, not strengths on the old ones.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, there&#8217;s no end of shortcomings.<\/p>\n<p>As I&#8217;ve detailed before, the main legal challenges fall under three categories:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Congressional Review Act:<\/strong> The Senate is one vote away from forcing a vote on the repeal of the rules \u2014 unlikely to succeed, but it would force Senators to publicly take a position in an election year while voters still have the issue fresh in their minds.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Administrative Procedure Act:<\/strong> Lawsuits may allege that last year&#8217;s rulemaking process was &#8220;arbitrary and capricious,&#8221; either because of the various inconsistencies in the FCC&#8217;s own process or because of the technical issues in the order itself. Lawsuits have already been filed.<\/li>\n<li><strong>State laws:<\/strong> Several states have already begun (or are nearing completion) legislation establishing their own net neutrality policies. The argument is that if the FCC gives up its powerful Title II authority, under which the previous rules were enforced, then it has no jurisdiction over state policy in this area. Lawsuits will be filed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You can read more about these <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/02\/22\/the-fccs-order-gutting-net-neutrality-is-now-official-but-the-fight-is-just-getting-started\/\">here<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/12\/14\/the-fcc-just-repealed-net-neutrality-what-happens-next\/\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Both sides are pushing for legislation to settle the issue once and for all, though of course each side wants rather different legislation. But that&#8217;s a longer game, and since it&#8217;s an election year it will almost certainly have to wait until 2019 or even 2020. Many politicians are calling for net neutrality to be presented as a major voter issue.<\/p>\n<p>The fact that little will change in the short time after the new rules take effect will be crowed about by their proponents as evidence that there was nothing nefarious about them. But the simple truth is that everyone with anything to gain by taking advantage of the new rules is too smart to do so until they know they&#8217;re on a solid legal footing. That won&#8217;t happen for quite a while.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, it must be said that while politicians struggle over legal definitions and justifications for different levels and types of net neutrality, the internet and web are evolving beyond that. The increasing ubiquity of encryption moots the arguments and methods of internet providers for establishing &#8220;fast lanes&#8221; and other interference.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not to say some shady tactics won&#8217;t emerge here and there. There are lots and lots of internet providers in the country and one might decide that the time is right to institute their &#8220;innovative&#8221; new policy of zero-rating partners&#8217; streaming video channels while throttling competitors.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why consumers must be vigilant. Do you see something new and weird in your new terms of service? Do you notice a suspicious bandwidth issue on certain sites or services? Tell us, or tell one of the advocacy organizations that has been fighting on your behalf all these years.

With Rapchat, there&#8217;s a library of 1,000+ beats from top producers, an instant recording studio in your pocket, and the network to distribute your music worldwide and be discovered&#8230;. all from a free app. Rapchat is disrupting the creation, collaboration, distribution, &amp; discovery of music via mobile.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We have a much bigger but also more active community than any other music creation app,&#8221; said Miller.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/phones2x.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p>While it&#8217;s clear the world needs another sharing platform like it needs a hole in the head, thanks to a rabid fan base and a great idea, the team has ensured that Rapchat is not, as they say, wicka-wicka-whack.

CPG is full of smart people, but many of the biggest brands have seen their sales stagnate or decline over the past several years.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Consumer companies can increase profit and deliver shareholder value by either growing in revenue or cutting costs, but the strategies these companies have taken to try to turn the tide just aren\u2019t working. When they innovate, they only make incremental changes to products (like reducing the fat of a potato chip), instead of offering consumers new products that they actually want.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Or they spend billions on advertising to convince consumers that they should buy existing products. If they can\u2019t increase revenue, they\u2019ll cut spending by stripping out valuable business teams or merging with other consumer companies to slash costs (\u00e0 la <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/gadfly\/articles\/2017-11-02\/kraft-heinz-s-smidge-of-sales-gains-gives-3g-work-to-do\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?hl=en&amp;q=https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/gadfly\/articles\/2017-11-02\/kraft-heinz-s-smidge-of-sales-gains-gives-3g-work-to-do&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1524579176646000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF60qB73GWfXX07Qcm_BGVgHm9oNw\">Kraft-Heinz<\/a>). These strategies do not position Big CPG for long-term success; I\u2019d like to suggest a few that might.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Before I dig in here, I want to say upfront that I don\u2019t have all the answers (or even most of them). I\u2019m the CEO of a startup with 65 employees &#8212; not a massive corporation with 30,000 employees. The insights I hope to share are gathered from more than a decade working in consumer investing and helping consumer companies grow, but they\u2019re ultimately insights from the outside looking in.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Replace \u201cKellogg\u2019s\u201d with the name of PepsiCo, Est\u00e9e Lauder, Nestl\u00e9, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/kraft\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"kraft\">Kraft <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a>-Heinz or countless other big brands and the observations should still resonate. This isn\u2019t about just one company, it\u2019s about the dynamics that exist for virtually all CPG incumbents.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img class=\"breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1189352\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/db_popular_brands_products.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"439\" \/><\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">What I would do differently<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On day one as CEO of Kellogg\u2019s, I would take a hard look in the mirror and I would ask myself which Kellogg\u2019s brands are still relevant and can grow. I recently had a conversation with a former VP of a major CPG company and he said that Big CPG is guilty of thinking that everything can be relevant if they bring the right news to it. I agree. As CEO, I would acknowledge upfront that we have certain brands and products that are cash cows now &#8212; but are slowly dying.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">An uncomfortable but proactive step would be to sell the legacy cash cows that are dying and invest the cash windfall into innovation. This week I was in another discussion with a 20-year veteran from a Fortune 100 consumer company who said, \u201cI think <span class=\"aBn\" tabindex=\"0\" data-term=\"goog_2017045989\"><span class=\"aQJ\">in 10 years<\/span><\/span> our company will no longer exist. It will be broken up.\u201d Conversations about selling legacy brands will make a lot of consumer executives squirm, but they are conversations that need to happen. Cutting the dying cash cows is the hardest, but probably most important, step in righting the ship.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After deciding which of our legacy brands to divest, my next step would be to publicly announce that we will shift focus away from cutting costs and towards investing in a culture of innovation to actually grow the business. This will likely cause our stock price to go down in the short term, but in the medium to long term this will help our company tremendously.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Simply put, we can\u2019t survive by cutting costs forever. We need to grow. Our culture of innovation will be built and promoted in a variety of ways. What follows isn\u2019t a sequential list but rather initiatives that should be pursued in parallel.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>1) Research and Development. <\/strong>We will signal to Wall Street that we are going to focus on growth and innovation, not cost-cutting. We\u2019re going to go through a rehaul of the R&amp;D process and pipeline and we will dare to dream bigger. In 2017, Kellogg\u2019s spent $148 million (1.1 percent of net revenue) on R&amp;D. This may at first sound like a lot, but for comparison, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/google\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"google\">Google <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> spent $16.6 billion (15 percent of net revenue) on R&amp;D during the same time period. The dichotomy between tech and consumer spending on this front is highlighted in the chart below.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>R&amp;D Spending as a Percentage of Annual Net Revenue<\/strong><\/p>\n<div style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"CToWUd a6T\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/xgcndVw_9FSbEIbsqxFx3zZXN3eluzpKbwsfyb50WOvgf3pr_C_z5ohgBl3FlO2DFbI1LaSidesz3bNATEssYQEcl6qD4ZRd9O7hhBx_fqXK2HqNVC-hh4kWYrp_eiud-ttTyEDM\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"322\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: Company 10-Ks for 2017<\/p><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It\u2019s no wonder that one of these companies has been making Frosted Flakes the same way for more than 60 years (with goofy TV commercials for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=f6sw39pPrr8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?hl=en&amp;q=https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v%3Df6sw39pPrr8&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1524579176646000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEdjGk9vdJ5ic_SFTO_XLh83AsWsA\">most of that time<\/a>) while the other started as a search engine and now builds phones, maps and self-driving cars. Imagine how comical it would be for a tech company to sell the same product for five years, let alone 50. R&amp;D is not just about coming up with a new flavor or lowering the fat content of an existing product.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"CToWUd a6T alignright\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/kpXYkjtq7eosy08Mp7mEf7h1gXoEA99Qgco6c3AcvMNxdmmuN3ySZclJHXN2aQ2KMoAZeglc7IJv84OFVtLhI1DMg1D9h_6zd4YH3vSJTBQLywjPswXL0tXbqyNhTnOZNI4-gBJU\" alt=\"\" width=\"322\" height=\"301\" \/><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As one big CPG veteran told me recently &#8212; \u201cconsumers don\u2019t care about \u2018whiter whites\u2019 anymore.\u201d It involves building an adaptive infrastructure that truly listens to what consumers want and then relays that information to development teams in a way that allows them to be agile and effective. We need to have an R&amp;D team that is focused on the category and consumer, not the product. Instead of Pepsi thinking about a lower-fat potato chip, they need to be rethinking the snack category as a whole.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Why is it insane to imagine AB InBev developing a beer that doesn\u2019t cause hangovers, but it isn\u2019t crazy to imagine Elon Musk sending people to Mars? Why is it laughable for Clorox to invest a billion dollars into developing a non-toxic, safe substitute for bleach, but it\u2019s normal to imagine investing $15 billion into <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/uber\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"uber\">Uber <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> &#8212; a company that is trying to replace all taxis in the world and rethink transportation? Those comments are meant to push public CPG CEOs, not to degrade <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/space-exploration-technologies\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"space-exploration-technologies\">SpaceX <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> or Uber.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Good R&amp;D also involves keeping your ear to the ground for great ideas that may already be out there. There could be a toothpaste in India that would revolutionize the way we think about toothpaste in America, but we\u2019ll never know if we aren\u2019t listening. For an example of what can happen without this R&amp;D infrastructure, look no further than the pharmaceutical industry, where Big Pharma companies are now having to pay to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.biopharmatrend.com\/post\/30-pharma-rd-outsourcing-is-on-the-rise\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?hl=en&amp;q=https:\/\/www.biopharmatrend.com\/post\/30-pharma-rd-outsourcing-is-on-the-rise\/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1524579176646000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHhwE-tUhfqvmK0Is-qH-9iCcRj7g\">outsource innovation<\/a> because they can\u2019t foster it in-house. CPG is becoming Big Pharma.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>2) Incubation.<\/strong> In addition to investing in and partnering with great consumer companies, we will provide space and expertise in-house to help them grow. Kellogg\u2019s recently partnered with Conagra Brands and the City of Chicago to invest in a $34 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fooddive.com\/news\/why-conagra-and-kellogg-invested-in-a-34m-startup-incubator-in-chicago\/509762\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?hl=en&amp;q=https:\/\/www.fooddive.com\/news\/why-conagra-and-kellogg-invested-in-a-34m-startup-incubator-in-chicago\/509762\/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1524579176646000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE6JXvrQ2n_2owMZAqyawTBMiRjKg\">million food incubator<\/a> that is expected to support around 75 companies, 80 percent of which will be in the snack category. This is definitely a step in the right direction, but I\u2019d want us to go bigger and take the operation in-house. I\u2019d like to incubate 100+ companies per year from a wide variety of categories and become the Y Combinator for consumer. This will be a win-win. We get to help great consumer companies grow and these companies get to leverage our expertise and infrastructure.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>3) Venture capital.<\/strong> Too many CPG companies only invest in brands once those brands are 5+ years old &#8212; and end up paying a huge sum as a result. I would change our mandate to invest in companies that will be interesting 10 years out &#8212; not just companies that we think are going to contribute immediately to our revenue or existing product strategy. We need to take the long view here, and data plays a big role. Kellogg\u2019s will not identify innovation just by sending a dozen people to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xFf40t2abQQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?hl=en&amp;q=https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v%3DxFf40t2abQQ&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1524579176647000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF0V6W3EzGC3BYN60qs5WaqOBSBew\">Expo West<\/a>. We need a non-commoditized data and technology solution that can help us identify breakout brands early by looking at their growth potential &#8212; not their Expo sales booth. Kellogg\u2019s is actually ahead of most CPGs when it comes to venture in that they have a venture arm of <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/06\/20\/kellogg-launches-vc-fund\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?hl=en&amp;q=http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/06\/20\/kellogg-launches-vc-fund\/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1524579176647000&amp;usg=AFQjCNETYRcb9jtrs3y2pYiuonL5J0UMRQ\">$100 million<\/a>. But this is still too small.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I would start by having our venture arm manage assets of $500 million (less than 4 percent of net revenue, but still 50x the AuM of many CPG corporate venture arms) and tell them they are going to invest in 200-300 companies, focusing on early-stage companies with less than $10 million in revenue over the next 2-4 years. If that sounds insane, look at Google\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gv.com\/portfolio\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?hl=en&amp;q=https:\/\/www.gv.com\/portfolio\/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1524579176647000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHERHMsljIUuknEI26bt5TZ3-0hKw\">GV<\/a> for some inspiration. They built a diverse portfolio to foster innovation from many, and sometimes unexpected, angles. If tech VCs can have a portfolio of hundreds of companies, so can we. A venture arm in consumer is nothing new. Many large CPG companies have launched venture arms, but most of these consumer VCs only plan to invest around $5-$10 million across three to four companies. Then the CEO loses his or her nerve, succumbs to the pressure of short-term cost cutting, and bails on the strategy. We will dare to take the long view.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Beyond just capital, I would create a structure that provides these companies resources and support to help them be successful. We will create a program to allow for externships between Kellogg\u2019s (and possibly our partners) and the portfolio companies we invest into. Hardly a week goes by that I don\u2019t receive an email from a brand manager, marketer, supply chain expert or others at one of these public CPGs that are looking to move to a smaller company. This externship program will be an asset for the smaller brands while also acting as a retention tool and bringing innovation back to Kellogg\u2019s.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>4) M&amp;A.<\/strong> I\u2019m not against M&amp;A, but I am against M&amp;A for the sole purpose of stripping cost as a strategy to deliver long-term shareholder value. My belief is that <span class=\"aBn\" tabindex=\"0\" data-term=\"goog_2017045990\"><span class=\"aQJ\">in 10 years<\/span><\/span> the revenue from the core existing products of many consumer companies will be much smaller than it is today. These products won\u2019t be replaced by one or two new products, they\u2019ll be replaced by hundreds &#8212; or thousands. That is the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.morganstanley.com\/ideas\/big-brand-disruption\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?hl=en&amp;q=https:\/\/www.morganstanley.com\/ideas\/big-brand-disruption&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1524579176647000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGZgmwN_AE9i0DsXnEtQapplwUI2g\">fragmentation of the consumer<\/a>, or what we have called in the past the Personalization of the Consumer. Big CPG can either buy these products (at an earlier stage) or lose to them. I would want our company to ingest a lot of smaller brands rather than forking out hundreds of millions (or billions) of dollars once these brands are already big. We will need to also invest in the infrastructure necessary to work with many more brands and benefit from their growth. The brands will join the Kellogg\u2019s family rather than threatening it.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>5) Partnerships and joint ventures. <\/strong>Every now and then you will hear about a joint venture or partnership in consumer, but they are few and far between. Why? I think a lot of times big consumer companies fear that partnering with another company will mean splitting profits, which can negatively impact bottom line. This is not a productive attitude. You see examples of successful partnerships in almost every other industry &#8212; whether it\u2019s Google <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/08\/23\/technology\/google-walmart-e-commerce-partnership.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?hl=en&amp;q=https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/08\/23\/technology\/google-walmart-e-commerce-partnership.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1524579176647000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE063QHynn_TIiLts2Zz2aOHtTJWw\">teaming up<\/a> with <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/walmart\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"walmart\">Walmart <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> to offer Walmart products on Google Express, or Chrysler <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/fd96456a-fc2b-11e7-9b32-d7d59aace167\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?hl=en&amp;q=https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/fd96456a-fc2b-11e7-9b32-d7d59aace167&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1524579176647000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH0cqcjlQ9I1rvgSrpoaFpMl3dZFw\">teaming up <\/a>with Waymo to work on driverless cars, partnering with a variety of stakeholders can often help foster the best innovation. I also think there is a big opportunity to partner with other consumer companies to foster education in the sector itself. We could host conferences that bring together the best consumer entrepreneurs and the brightest ideas and we would all benefit as a result.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1019320\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/cereal.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" \/><\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Why this matters<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If my plan as CEO were effectively implemented, I think we would see three powerful effects. Firstly, by making more small bets on more emerging brands and building a culture of innovation, Kellogg\u2019s would become a dominant player in consumer goods. They will no longer fear being displaced. They will be the ones creating and harnessing the disruption. Secondly, this road map would ensure that the best products make it into the hands of consumers and that everyone has access to a wider variety of foods and healthier options. Finally, by building this infrastructure, Kellogg\u2019s would be able to assist entrepreneurs with their distribution, brand, supply chain and team. As these companies grow and succeed, this will also result in increased value for shareholders. Consumer is an extremely inefficient market, but Kellogg\u2019s can be the public company that helps change that.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Again, it\u2019s easy for me to suggest strategies like this. It\u2019s much harder to implement them when you\u2019re on the inside looking out. I think a lot of Big CPG CEOs probably do have bold ideas that would help their companies in the long run, they are just unable to pursue them in an environment that obsesses on the short term &#8212; a board that demands immediate cost cuts and a market that demands immediate stock value.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So these CEOs are hamstrung and left to rearrange chairs on the deck of the Titanic while the whole ship is sinking. They fear that if they do too much to try to save the ship they won\u2019t last long. Gates, Musk and Bezos are free to be visionary and push their companies to the cutting edge of innovation, while Cahillane (CEO of Kellogg\u2019s), Hees (Kraft-<a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/h-j-heinz-company\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"h-j-heinz-company\">Heinz) <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and Quincey (Coke) have to work within the box they are put in. I truly hope that big consumer companies will begin to innovate, be creative and listen to what consumers want &#8212; and that corporate boards and Wall Street will realize the long-term value of these things. If the industry doesn\u2019t evolve, you never know, Google might just step in with the next big breakfast cereal.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The world of consumer goods is changing.

White indicated that the original contract award is for just two years. After that there are two additional options for five years and three years. The department can opt out after the first two years if it&#8217;s not working out, or seven years if it accepts the second option. Obviously if it takes the final option, that would add up to a full 10-year commitment.<\/p>\n<p>Leigh Madden, who heads up Microsoft&#8217;s defense effort, says he believes Microsoft can win such a contract, but it isn&#8217;t necessarily the best approach for the DoD. &#8220;If the DoD goes with a single award path, we are in it to win, but having said that, it\u2019s counter to what we are seeing across the globe where 80 percent of customers are adopting a multi-cloud solution,&#8221; Madden told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>White indicated that 46 companies have responded to the request for proposal, but it seems clear there are only a handful of companies that could handle a project of this scope. For starters, we have Amazon and Microsoft, along with Google, IBM and Oracle.<\/p>\n<p>That said, White indicated that companies can band together and form a partnership, which means you could see some extremely strange bedfellows trying to form the equivalent of a rock supergroup with multiple players coming together to win the deal.<\/p>\n<p>This development certainly opens up some interesting options for the vendors involved and creates a level of competition and alliances the likes of which the tech industry might have never seen. Whoever gets the contract, they get two years to prove they can do this, then they will be evaluated before getting a shot at the second five-year window.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When the Department of Defense announced in March\u00a0a 10-year winner-take-all cloud contract that could be worth up to $10 billion, it raised a few eyebrows.

While this has been a bummer for consumers looking for more contextual services from the apps they have installed, this also has been a pain for marketers keen to get their hands on more quality user data.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/bluedotinnovation.com\/\">Bluedot Innovation<\/a> wants to tackle this by building out tech that can zero-in on smartphone users&#8217; locations in the background. Bluedot announced today they have raised $5.5 million in Series A funding led by a major toll road company, Transurban. The Melbourne startup has raised $13 million to date.<\/p>\n<p>The startup&#8217;s tech focuses on dialing-in user location data to just a few meters so that companies utilizing the API can tell whether their marketing efforts are actually turning into consumers visiting physical locations. There are no shortage of players in this space; what makes Bluedot unique, the company insists, is their focus on R&amp;D to develop more precise, low-power solutions that rely on networks and a variety of sensors in the phone to deliver data insightful enough that customers can distinguish what users are doing in tighter urban areas and how they&#8217;re getting around.<\/p>\n<p>Bluedot had initially focused its efforts entirely on developing a service that could make mobile payments for toll roads, the idea being that rather than having to install something on your windshield, you could just download an app, allowing persistent location access so whenever you drove through a tollway that had been mapped within the app, you&#8217;d make a payment without any friction.<\/p>\n<p>The startup&#8217;s ambitions have certainly expanded since then, particularly through a partnership with Salesforce, though given the fact that this round was led by a toll road company it suffices to say that this use case is still firmly within their sights.

of revenue growth &#8211; again, thanks to digital music consumption. Global recorded music revenues reached $17.4 billion in 2017, up from $16 billion in 2016 &#8211; an annual growth rate of 8. percent. Streaming revenues in particular have contributed to this growth, and were up 39 percent year-over-year to reach $7.4 billion, or 43 percent of all revenues.<\/p>\n<p>That offset some of the declines from legacy formats, like downloads and physical albums, which fell by $783 million.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"vertical alignnone size-large wp-image-1626648\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/mrm1804-fig0-5-724x1024.png?w=481\" alt=\"\" width=\"481\" height=\"680\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In the U.S., digital revenue last year grew 15 percent to $6.5 billion, up from $5.65 billion the year before. A good-sized portion of those revenues came from streaming music subscriptions, which grew 63 percent from $2.5 billion in 2016 to $4 billion in 2017.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. has also become the most important streaming market worldwide, accounting for 40 percent of total global\u00a0 recorded music revenues. Thanks to the innovation and diversity of music services available in the U.S., the report predicts than the number of paid music subscribers will reach 90.1 million by 2025 &#8211; nearly double today&#8217;s number of $49.1 million.<\/p>\n<p>The report comes from\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.midiaresearch.com\/\">MIDiA Research<\/a>, a media and technology analysis company, in partnership with digital media association,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/dima.org\/\">DiMA<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1626650\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/streaming-forward-key-takeaways.png?w=526\" alt=\"\" width=\"526\" height=\"680\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In addition to digital&#8217;s ability to grow revenues, the changes in how people are consuming music have had other impacts as well.<\/p>\n<p>For starters, the ease of using streaming services has led to an over 50 percent decline in music piracy since 2013, and has driven discovery of more diverse genres and artists, the report claims. It offered a couple of key examples of this, including how Chance the Rapper became the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/2017\/02\/12\/chance-the-rapper-first-streaming-only-grammy\/\">first &#8220;streaming-only&#8221; artist<\/a> to win a Grammy, and how six out of the top ten music videos on YouTube were Spanish-language &#8211; with hits like &#8220;Despacito&#8221; reaching a billion views in 97 days.<\/p>\n<p>Another big change in the new streaming landscape, is how powerful playlists have become. 54 percent of consumers now say that playlists are replacing albums in their listening habits.<\/p>\n<p>The\u00a0$1.4 billion of revenue growth the industry has seen year-over-year puts the global total just below 2008 levels ($17.7 billion), the report also said.

Called the I.D. R Pikes Peak, two electric engines are good for 680 hp and 479 lb-ft of torque. The whole package weighs less than 2,500 lbs and VW says the vehicle is good for a 0-60 time of 2.25 seconds. That makes this car faster off the line than a <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/formula\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"formula\">Formula 1 <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> or Formula E car &#8212; and just slightly faster than a Model S launching in Ludicrous mode.<\/p>\n<p>VW says the racer was developed as an exercise in balancing weight and electrical energy capacity. This racer uses lithium-ion batteries and the dual electric motors act as generators during breaking, allowing the vehicle to recapture lost energy and feed it back into the batteries.<\/p>\n<p>The Pikes Peak race has long been used as a test bed for vehicle manufacturers. The race is a tough 4,720 vertical-foot climb up a winding path with 156 corners. A modified Peugeot 208 set the current record in 2013 of 8 minutes and 13 seconds, yet in 2016 a custom electric vehicle from Latvia came close to the record with a time of 8:57.118. The driver, Rhys Millen, says the run could have been up to 30 seconds quicker, but half of the vehicle&#8217;s powertrain failed halfway through the climb. This car, an eO PP100, had\u00a01,190 kilowatts (1,600\u00a0hp) torque 2520 Nm, with a weight of 1200 kg.<\/p>\n<p>Volkswagen&#8217;s attempt is to best the electric record with a vehicle significantly less powerful and almost twice as heavy.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-1626603\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/volkswagen_i-d-_r_pikes_peak-large-8198.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As for the comparison against the <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/tesla-motors\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"tesla-motors\">Tesla <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Model S, while the 0-60 speeds are similar on paper (2.25 seconds verse 2.3 seconds), it&#8217;s not fair to compare the two in real-world testing. In order to get the Tesla to hit 60 mph in 2.3 seconds, which is possible, specific conditions have to be met and it can only hit that speed off the line. The vehicle&#8217;s software also limits the amount of time the Model S is able to launch at this speed. Meanwhile, the VW racer is likely able to\u00a0accelerate at such velocity coming off corners again and again &#8212; racing tires help, too.<\/p>\n<p>Often, if racing up a mountain or around a road track, the ability to recover from dips in speed\u00a0is where races are won, and with 156 corners, there are plenty of opportunities for Volkswagen to recover from dips.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Volkswagen is entering the yearly race up Pikes Peak with a lightweight custom racer.

Paul was drawn to robots from an early age because of the awe and wonder of watching your creation come to life in the real world, and developed a deeper passion for the field when he recognized the empowerment that comes from creating something that can have real, tangible impact for good. In graduate school at UC Berkeley, Paul worked on how to design robots intelligently and wholistically such that the mechanisms, sensors, electronics and software complement each other to create simple yet robust solutions to specific problems. This design mentality led to the technologies that launched Paul\u2019s first company, Dash Robotics, where he was a co-founder and CTO. Started during his PhD and derived from his research, Dash Robotics focused on making low-cost, build-it-yourself, bio-inspired legged robots available to kids to promote STEM engagement.

In 2001 he became the first manager to win three championships in a row since the league began in 1888, a feat he repeated in 2009.<\/p>\n\n<p>Admired for placing his emphasis on attacking football, with homegrown talent at the heart of his teams, he bowed out as league champion following his 1,500th game in charge of Manchester United.<\/p>\n\n<p>In 2012, Harvard Business School wrote the case study \u201cSir Alex Ferguson: Managing Manchester United\u201d before appointing him as a Fellow to the Executive Education Programme.<\/p>\n\n<p>Following his retirement in 2013 he took up the positions of both Director and Global Ambassador with Manchester United and was also appointed Coaching Ambassador by UEFA. In the same year he released \"My Autobiography\"\u200b which became the UK's quickest selling non-fiction book since records began. This work was a follow-up to his first best-selling memoir, \"Managing My Life\", which appeared in 1999.<\/p>\n\n<p>His new book \u2018Leading\u2019, written with Sir Michael Moritz, details the key skills and philosophies he used to deliver success both on and off the field and will be released in September 2015.<\/p>","cbAvatar":"https:\/\/crunchbase-production-res.cloudinary.com\/image\/upload\/v1447886197\/fch0vdzg78dny7x125vq.jpg","company":"Manchester United Football Club Limited","featured":0,"name":"Sir Alex Ferguson","position":"Director, Football Board","links":{"crunchbase":"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/person\/sir-alex-ferguson","twitter":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/furious_fergie","linkedin":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/siralexferguson"}},{"bio":"<p>Martha is  founder and executive chair of Doteveryone.org.uk.

He is the founder of Khosla Ventures, a firm focused on assisting entrepreneurs to build impactful new energy and technology companies. Vinod grew up dreaming of being an entrepreneur, despite being from an Indian army household with no business or technology connections. Since the age of 16, when he first heard about the founding of Intel, he dreamt of starting his own technology company.<\/p>\n\n<p>After graduating with a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in New Delhi, Vinod failed to start a soymilk company to service the many people in India who did not have refrigerators. Instead, he came to the U.S. to further his academic studies and received a master\u2019s degree in biomedical engineering from Carnegie Mellon University. Eventually, his startup dreams led him to Silicon Valley, where he received a master\u2019s degree in business administration from the Stanford University Graduate School of Business.<\/p>\n\n<p>Upon graduation, Vinod co-founded Daisy Systems, the first significant computer-aided design system for electrical engineers. The company went on to achieve significant revenue, profits and an IPO. Then, driven by the frustration of having to design the computer hardware on which the Daisy software needed to be built, Vinod started the standards-based Sun Microsystems in 1982 to build workstations for software developers. As the founding CEO of Sun, he pioneered open systems and commercial RISC processors. Sun Microsystems was funded by Vinod\u2019s longtime friend and board member John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers (KPCB).<\/p>\n\n<p>In 1986, Vinod joined KPCB as a general partner. While there, he played a crucial role in taking on Intel\u2019s monopoly by building and growing semiconductor company, Nexgen, which eventually was acquired by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Nexgen\/AMD was the only microprocessor to have significant success against Intel. Thereafter, Vinod helped incubate the idea and business plan for Juniper Networks to take on Cisco System\u2019s dominance of the router market. He also was involved in the formulation of the early advertising-based search strategy for Excite. In addition to his many other contributions at KPCB, he helped transform the moribund telecommunications business and its archaic SONET implementations with Cerent Corporation, which was acquired by Cisco Systems in 1999 for $7.2 billion.<\/p>\n\n<p>In 2004, driven by the need for flexibility to accommodate four teenaged children, the desire to be more experimental and to fund sometimes imprudent \u201cscience experiments,\u201d Vinod formed Khosla Ventures to focus on both for-profit and social impact investments. His goals remain the same: work and learn from fun and knowledgeable entrepreneurs, build impactful companies by leveraging innovation and spend time with a partnership that makes a difference. Vinod has a passion for nascent technologies that have beneficial effects and economic impact on society. While he only serves on the boards of a few select companies, he works closely with most KV companies as they face transitions or key decisions.<\/p>\n\n<p>Vinod\u2019s greatest passion is being a mentor to entrepreneurs building technology-based businesses. He is driven by the desire to make a positive impact through scaling new energy sources, achieving petroleum independence and promoting a pragmatic approach to the environment. He also is passionate about social entrepreneurship with a special emphasis on microfinance as a poverty alleviation tool. He is a supporter of many microfinance organizations in India and Africa. He also has been experimenting with innovations in education and global housing.<\/p>\n\n<p>Vinod also is a charter member of The Indus Entrepreneurs (TiE), a non-profit global network of entrepreneurs and professionals that was founded in 1992 and has more than 40 chapters in nine countries today. He is a founding board member of the Indian School of Business (ISB). Vinod holds a bachelor of technology degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in New Delhi, India, a master\u2019s degree in biomedical engineering from Carnegie Mellon University and a master\u2019s degree in business administration from the Stanford University Graduate School of Business.<\/p>","cbAvatar":"https:\/\/crunchbase-production-res.cloudinary.com\/image\/upload\/v1415770904\/hworsg4axlgtxjyc7csk.png","company":"Khosla Ventures","featured":0,"name":"Vinod Khosla","position":"Founder and Partner","links":{"crunchbase":"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/person\/vinod-khosla","twitter":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/vkhosla","linkedin":"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pub\/vinod-khosla\/16\/874\/653"}}],"sponsorships":[],"subPages":[{"id":1564879,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/disrupt-sf-2018\/startup-alley\/","title":"Startup Alley","type":"standard"}],"ticketInfo":{"block_information":{"title":"Tickets","subtitle":"Whether you are a marketer, job seeker, founder or investor, there's a pass type that gets you the access to Disrupt SF you seek at a great price point.
